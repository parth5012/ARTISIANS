# Artify Labs

## An AI-Powered Marketplace for Local Artisans

Artify Labs is an innovative platform designed to empower local artisans by providing them with a modern marketplace to showcase and sell their unique creations. Our mission is to connect artisans directly with customers, fostering appreciation for traditional craftsmanship and the stories behind each product.

## Key Features:

*   **Artisan Storytelling:** Artisans can share their personal stories, cultural heritage, and the intricate history behind their products, creating a deeper connection with buyers.
*   **AI-Powered Description Generation:** Leverage cutting-edge AI to generate compelling and vivid product descriptions, making it easier for artisans to present their work professionally.
*   **3D Product Showcase:** Sellers have the option to upload 3D models of their products, offering customers an immersive and interactive viewing experience.
*   **Seamless E-commerce Experience:** A user-friendly interface for both artisans to manage their storefronts and for customers to discover and purchase unique artisanal goods.

## Technologies Used (Proposed for Prototype):

*   **Frontend:** React (TypeScript) with Bootstrap for a responsive UI and `three.js` for 3D model viewing.
*   **Backend:** Python with FastAPI for a high-performance API, especially suited for AI integration.
*   **Database:** SQLite (for prototype simplicity).

Our goal is to celebrate local art, preserve cultural heritage, and create a sustainable ecosystem for artisans worldwide.
